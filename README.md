Casefile is a bookmark manager on steroids, including:

* A _Casefile_ tab that displays all bookmarks in the project
* Bookmarks that include text to find at (or around) the designated location
* Drag-and-drop reordering and hierarchical organization of bookmarks
* User-supplied notes on bookmarks
* Bookmark locations linked to specific commits (for Git-managed projects), allowing the bookmarked text to be located even after the file is modified

## Configuration

If you have your `git` or `diff` tools installed in any unusual directories, make sure to set the *Tool Path* setting appropriately.
